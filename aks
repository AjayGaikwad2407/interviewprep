    🔹 1. Control Plane Components
        These manage the overall cluster state.
        ✅ API Server (kube-apiserver)
            Entry point for all Kubernetes commands (kubectl, REST API, other components).
            Validates and processes API requests.
            Stores the desired state in etcd.
        ✅ etcd
            A distributed key-value store.
            Stores all cluster data (desired + current state).
            Example: deployments, pod definitions, config maps, secrets.
            Highly available (usually deployed as a cluster).
        ✅ Controller Manager (kube-controller-manager)
            Runs background controllers that ensure the desired state = current state.
            Examples:
            Node controller → Monitors node health.
            Replication controller → Ensures correct number of pod replicas.
            Endpoint controller → Manages service endpoints.
        ✅ Scheduler (kube-scheduler)
            Decides which node runs a new Pod.
            Considers:
            Resource requests (CPU, memory).
            Affinity/anti-affinity rules.
            Taints/tolerations.
            Workload balancing.
    🔹 2. Worker Node Components
        These run the actual application workloads.
        ✅ Kubelet
            Agent running on each node.
            Communicates with the API server.
            Ensures containers in pods are running as expected (via container runtime).
        ✅ Kube-proxy
            Manages network rules on each node.
            Enables service discovery and routing.
            Handles traffic load-balancing to backend pods.
        ✅ Container Runtime
            The actual engine that runs containers.
            Examples: containerd, CRI-O, Docker (deprecated for kubelet).
