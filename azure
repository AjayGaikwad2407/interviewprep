application gateway:
    🔹 1. Azure Load Balancer (Layer 4 - TCP/UDP)
        Works at the Transport Layer (L4).
        Distributes inbound/outbound traffic based on IP and port.
        Two SKUs:
            Basic Load Balancer → simple, for dev/test workloads, limited features.
            Standard Load Balancer → highly available, supports zones, secure by default, better scaling, supports both inbound and outbound rules.
        Supports:
            Public Load Balancer → balances internet traffic to VMs.
            Internal Load Balancer (ILB) → balances traffic inside a Virtual Network (VNet).
        Use case: Balancing TCP/UDP traffic to backend VMs or VM Scale Sets.
    🔹 2. Azure Application Gateway (Layer 7 - HTTP/HTTPS)
        Works at the Application Layer (L7).
        Provides application-aware load balancing.
        Features:
            SSL/TLS termination (offloading).
            Path-based routing (/images → image servers, /api → API servers).
            Host-based routing (multi-site hosting).
            Web Application Firewall (WAF).
            URL-based redirection & session affinity.
        Use case: Web applications (HTTP/HTTPS) requiring routing and security features.
    🔹 3. Azure Traffic Manager (DNS-based Global Load Balancer)
        Works at the DNS level.
        Routes client requests to the nearest or best-performing endpoint.
        Uses different traffic-routing methods:
            Priority (failover).
            Weighted (load distribution).
            Performance (lowest latency).
            Geographic (based on region).
            Subnet and multi-value routing.
            Endpoints can be Azure, external services, or hybrid.
        Use case: Global traffic distribution across regions.
    🔹 4. Azure Front Door (Layer 7 - Global Application Delivery)
        Works at Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) but globally.
        Provides:
            Global load balancing.
            Web Application Firewall (WAF).
            SSL offloading.
            Anycast-based routing.
            Dynamic site acceleration (DSA).
            Path- and host-based routing.
            Unlike Traffic Manager (DNS-based), Front Door is real-time and works at the edge.
        Use case: High-performance, global websites and APIs.
    🔹 5. Azure NAT Gateway (Outbound Only)
        Not a load balancer in the strictest sense, but often confused.
        Provides outbound internet connectivity for VMs in private subnets.
        Handles SNAT (Source Network Address Translation) at scale.
        Doesn't distribute inbound traffic.
        Use case: Ensure scalable outbound connections for large workloads.

Private endpoint vs service endpoint
    service endpoint:
        Extends your VNet’s private IP space to an Azure service over Microsoft’s backbone network.
        When enabled, traffic to that Azure service from your VNet uses Azure’s internal network instead of the public internet.
        Key points:
            Uses public IP of the service but traffic flows securely through Azure backbone.
            No private IP is assigned to the service inside your VNet.
            Access is controlled using VNet Service Endpoint Policies.
            Easy to configure, no DNS changes needed.
            Supported services: Azure Storage, Azure SQL Database, Cosmos DB, Key Vault, Event Hub, etc.
        ✅ Use case:
            If you want to secure access to an Azure PaaS service only from specific VNets, without exposing it publicly.
    Private endpoint:
        Assigns a private IP from your VNet to the Azure service (like Storage, SQL, Key Vault, etc.).
        Effectively brings the PaaS resource into your VNet.
        Traffic flows entirely within the VNet using that private IP.
        Uses Private Link for secure connectivity.
        Requires DNS configuration to resolve the service name to the private IP.
        More secure because:
            Public access to the service can be disabled completely.
            Only accessible via private IP in your VNet (and peered VNets if allowed).
        ✅ Use case:
        If you want your Azure PaaS resource to be completely private, accessible only via your VNet, and you don’t want any public endpoint exposure.
