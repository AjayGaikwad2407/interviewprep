why want to work in energy

“I want to work in the energy industry because it’s at the forefront of innovation and transformation. 
With the growing focus on renewable energy, sustainability, and smart technologies, the sector is using cloud, 
AI, and data platforms like never before. I see a huge opportunity to apply my skills in DevOps, automation, 
and cloud to help drive efficiency, reliability, and scalability in such a critical industry. 
Being part of a sector that directly impacts people’s lives and contributes to a sustainable 
future is very motivating for me.


team vs individual

“I enjoy both working as part of a team and contributing individually. When working in a team, I value collaboration, 
brainstorming, and learning from others’ perspectives. It often leads to better solutions and knowledge sharing. 
At the same time, I’m equally comfortable working as an individual contributor, taking ownership of tasks, 
troubleshooting issues, and ensuring delivery.

For me, the key is balance — collaborating with the team when alignment is needed, and then driving tasks 
independently to move things forward.”
